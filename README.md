# Shivam's Projects Repository

Welcome to Shivam's Projects Repository! This repository serves as a showcase of my diverse range of projects, reflecting my passion for software development and continual learning. Below, you'll find details about each project along with the technologies used and how to explore them further.

## Projects

### Library Management System

- **Description:** Designed and implemented a robust Library Management System using Java, incorporating key principles of object-oriented programming for scalability and maintainability.
- **Features:**
  - Efficient book tracking with functionalities for check-in/out, issuance of library cards, and data persistence using file handling.

### Conference Event Planner

- **Description:** This project demonstrates the creation of a dynamic user interface that updates in real time based on user selections. It features components for venue selection, add-ons, and meal options, with Redux integration to manage state changes effectively.
- **Key Features:**
  - **Dynamic User Interface:** Components update in real time based on user interactions, including venue selection, add-ons, and meal options.
  - **State Management with Redux:** Utilizes Redux Toolkit for state management, including Redux slices to handle different sections of the state.
  - **Real-Time Cost Calculation:** A table displays selected items and their costs in a pop-up window, calculating and displaying subtotals and total costs based on user selections.
  - **Component Composition:** Functional React components are created using component composition and nesting to build a modular UI.
  - **React Hooks:** Implements `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage component-level state and control the visibility of elements.
  - **Dynamic Data Rendering:** Dynamically renders data from arrays into the UI, using array mapping to generate lists of components.
  - **Event Handling and Conditional Rendering:** Handles user events such as button clicks and triggers corresponding actions to update the UI accordingly.

### Command Line Interpreter

- **Description:** Developed a custom command-line interpreter (CLI), named shell, inspired by Unix shells, utilizing C programming language, demonstrating proficiency in systems programming.
- **Key Features:**
  - **Custom CLI Development:** Utilized C programming language to create the shell, incorporating functions like `fork()`, `execv()`, `waitpid()`, and `chdir()` for process management, command execution, and directory changes.
